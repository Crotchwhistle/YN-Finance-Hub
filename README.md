# YN Finance Hub

A simple Personal Finance Tracker/Management web app. You can add accounts and transactions (through CSV import as well), and categorise them. 

This project uses Nextjs, React and Honojs with the help of this [great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_uNKAus0II).

Currently, you can access the web app by cloning the repository and building it yourself, as there seem to be some issues with Nextjs. The list of packages required are in the `package.json` file.

Ignore the name of the project 🙏🙏🙏
